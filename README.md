# Zignaly Project Documentation

This project was bootstrapped with [React.js, Node.js, Express & MongoDB](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
The Backend api is hosted in [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). But we can access the backend code and if someone wants to play with api, they can clone the repo and run the backend locally.

## How to run the project

First, you need to download the Backend and Frontend code directory into your PC. To do that, you can use the following command:

Note: Your PC should have git, node and npm installed.

Step 1: Go the your command terminal and type the following command to download the backend:
### `git clone https://github.com/Pro-official/zignaly-project-server.git`
Step 2: Go to your command terminal and type the following command to download the frontend:
### `git clone https://github.com/Pro-official/zignaly-project-client.git`
Step 3: cd to both directory and run ### `npm install` in order to install all the dependencies.

Step 4: Now you can run both server and client by typing ### `npm start` in their own directory.


You can find the mock JSON data in the root directory of the project named "phones.json".
